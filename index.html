                    Hey, I'm a <strong>software engineer</strong> based in
                    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/MN7T61E1QpeG8CAQ6" target="_blank">Jerez de la Frontera</a>,
                    with over 10 years of experience in the field. I've spent most of my time crafting web apps with
                    <strong>Python</strong>, particularly with <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong>. Recently
                    (last 4 years, really), I've been delving into <strong>data engineering</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exploring data engineering has been fascinating! I'm diving into tools like
                    <strong>PySpark</strong>, <strong>dbt</strong>, and <strong>Airflow</strong>. What's cool is that I'm
                    bringing my traditional software development skills into this new realm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I'm all about family time, staying active, and experimenting in the kitchen.
                    Have way too many hobbies, really. More than I can spend my time on, but trying my best!

                    <p>
                        Upon joining a new team, I played a pivotal role in a company-wide initiative aimed at enhancing data ingestion
                        processes from our clients, placing significant emphasis on data quality and observability. The overarching
                        objective was to identify and address issues proactively before they reached end users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In pursuit of these objectives, I spearheaded various initiatives including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Facilitating seamless integration between our customer's Snowflake platform and our Data Lake</li>
                        <li>Implementing data quality metrics at different stages of our ingestion pipeline and establishing automated
                            reporting mechanisms to DataDog</li>
                        <li>Establishing the groundwork for an ingestion API tailored for our customers' use</li>
                    </ul>

                                While we didn't build the iOS app from scratch, we took over another agency's code,
                                and delivered many important updates, fixes and additions
                                (for instance integration with a bluetooth beacons system to localize a user inside the gallery)
                                alongside an  Android sister app. For this project I was in charge of the iOS app.
