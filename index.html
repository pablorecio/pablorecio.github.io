            <p>
                I am a web developer based in Bristol, UK, with over 7 years experience in the industry,
                where most of my experience has been developing complex web applications
                using Django. I've worked in projects of many shapes and colours,
                as coder and as tech lead.
            </p>
            <p>
                More recently I've been focusing a bit more on iOS development with
                Swift. While I am nowhere near as proficient with it as I am with Python,
                it's a really cool world I would like to be doing more of!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I try to do (probably too) many things, but mostly spending
                time with my family, running and cooking.

                <h3>Potato London Ltd.</h3>
                <h4>Senior Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    Started as a backend developer, in Potato I became a senior
                    developer and got to lead multiple projects. Most of them
                    are projects for Google under NDA. However, some of the work
                    I can show:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong><a href="https://p.ota.to/work/tate/" target="_blank">Tate iOS app</a></strong>
                        <p>
                            While we didn't build the iOS app from scratch, we took over another agency's code,
                            and deliver some important updates, fixes and additions to the app. For this project
                            I was in charge of the iOS app.

                        <p>
                            A complete revamp of the website for a London based investment management company.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    During my time at Potato I've also been involved with open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/potatolondon/djangae">Djangae</a>,
                    and became very familiar with Google's platform.

                <p>
                    First full-time job, where I learned more about Python and Django. As part
                    of my job there, I was one of the main developers of a Django CMS called
                    <a href="https://github.com/merengue-cms/merengueproj">Merengue</a>, which we used
                    for projects like the <a href="http://www.uma.es/">University of Malaga</a> site, and
                    some spinoff sites for the <a href="http://www.ugr.es/">University of Granada</a>.

                <p>
                    During this internship, I learned about web development using PHP and Drupal.
                    Those were dark times, but it was an amazing experience!
