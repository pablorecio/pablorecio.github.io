            <p>
                I am a <strong>web developer</strong> based in Bristol, UK, with over 7 years experience in the industry,
                where most of my experience has been developing <strong>complex web applications
                using Django</strong>. I've worked in projects of many shapes and colours,
                as coder and as tech lead.
            </p>
            <p>
                More recently I've been focusing a bit more on iOS development with
                <strong>Swift</strong>. While I am nowhere near as proficient with it as I am with Python,
                it's a really cool world I would like to be doing more of!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I try to do (probably too) many things, but mostly spending
                time with my family, running and cooking.

                    <p>
                        Started as a backend developer, in Potato I became a senior
                        developer and got to lead multiple projects. Most of them
                        are projects for Google under NDA. However, some of the work
                        I can show:

                                While we didn't build the iOS app from scratch, we took over another agency's code,
                                and deliver some important updates, fixes and additions to the app. For this project
                                I was in charge of the iOS app.

                        and became very familiar with Google's platform.
